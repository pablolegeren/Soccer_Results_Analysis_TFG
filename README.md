# Trabajo de Fin de Grado.
This repository includes what was my Bachelor's Degree Final Project. It is a probability model for the analysis of soccer results, specifically those of La Liga.

Using the Poisson distribution and historical data on the results of the Spanish League, a model is built to predict the number of goals scored by each of the teams in a matchup, depending on their own performance and the performance of their opponents and of the other teams in La Liga.
