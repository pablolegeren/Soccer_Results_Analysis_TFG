# Trabajo de Fin de Grado.
This repository includes what was my Bachelor's Degree Final Project. It is a probability model for the analysis of soccer results, specifically those of La Liga.

FINAL GRADE: 9'2

Using the Poisson distribution and historical data on the results of the Spanish League, a model is built to predict the number of goals scored by each of the teams in a matchup, depending on their own performance and the performance of their opponents and of the other teams in La Liga.

The pdf document is the final result of the work, it shows the results of the code included in the "TFG.Rmd" file. The results obtained are compared with the expected ones and an evaluation of the model is made, opening possible future lines of improvement and study.

Feel free to explore both the code and the final work in this repository and any improvements that can be implemented feel free to let me know.
